WIP! Still many updates to go.

BE WARNED. This is the most realistic / performance-heavy house I could make (and its not even done yet), so it may have performance limitations on older hardware. Sorry for the minimal updates... I'm doing college stuff

Thanks to YuLun for the sectional gate script. It was edited just a little to work with my electrical system. Original garage doors can be found here: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960021206]Sectional Garage Door[/url]

Thanks to Headcrab for creating the Dacia 1310 vehicle, which I used as the default spawn inside the garage. Original vehicle pack can be found here: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3259863888]Headcrab's Dacia 1310 Pack[/url]

[h2]Why is the house ever so slightly bigger then most teardown homes?[/h2]

I found that this size was optimal for detail / realism while still being pretty interactive ingame and NOT using any scaled voxels. Eventually the game is supposed to get features to control the player height / scale, and I might adjust that down the line.

Anyhow I built this house based after some place I went as a kid, so... I suppose if you want a story-based answer, its more realistic to the way I saw it back then ;)
